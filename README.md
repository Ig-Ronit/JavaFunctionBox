# JavaFunctionBox

Functionality:

This Java program contains a collection of functions encapsulated within a class named test_fun1. Each function serves a specific purpose, ranging from mathematical calculations to control flow operations.
It Allows users to perform various calculations and tasks through a user-friendly menu interface.

printAverage(): Computes and prints the average of three input numbers.
printSumofOdd(): Calculates and prints the sum of the first 'n' odd numbers.
printGreater(): Determines and prints the greater of two input numbers.
circumference(): Computes and displays the circumference of a circle given the radius.
eligibleForVote(): Checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age and prints the result.
infiniteLoop(): Demonstrates an infinite loop with a message printed infinitely.
findRaiseValue(): Calculates and prints the value of a number raised to a certain power.
fibonacci(): Generates and prints the Fibonacci series up to a specified limit.
findGCD(): Finds and prints the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two input numbers.
findSigns(): Reads a series of numbers from the user and counts the number of positive, negative, and zero values.
The main() function serves as the entry point for the program, where users can choose which function to execute based on their input. It provides a menu-driven interface for selecting the desired functionality.
